For this assignment, I know we were supposed to use the (prompt) command and console.log, however if this game is meant to be played in a console,
why not create a terminal with an existing jQuery library and make it look like a real terminal? 

In this version the computer can only play rock paper scissors, 
however in the next version, the player will be able to communicate with chatGPT. 

I am in the process of building this project with webpack-cli so I can use dotenv to obscure my API key. 

Unfortunately, I ran out of time doing this. 

You can play the game here: https://sturdybinder.github.io/jquery-terminal-rpg/

I hope you enjoy!
